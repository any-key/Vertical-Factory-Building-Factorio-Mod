# Vertorio
## Give your ingredients uppies ^~^
Vertical factory building pocket dimension Factorio mod that uses dependencies on Factorissimo (and currently Renai Transportation for proof of concept).  This mod will add some scripts and prototypes for linked belts and chests that merge into the machine's inventory.  Vertical input will have tiers of speed research as "pneumatic tubes" with a static sprite that appears at the center of the belt link (the floor between input and output) to create the illusion of vertical resource movement.  The goal is to simulate inserter spots that don't normally exist on buildings of such small footprints inside the multiple floors of a factorissimo building/surface.  Will also add 3D (spherical/columnal) beacons. :3
